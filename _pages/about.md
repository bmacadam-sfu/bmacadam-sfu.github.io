I am currently a postdoctoral fellow working with [KangKang Yin](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~kkyin/) at Simon Fraser University, as well as a Machine Learning Scientist at [CD PROJEKT RED](https://www.cdprojektred.com/en), where I work on applying generative models (particularly [score-based generative models](https://scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io/)) to animation.

Before joining SFU/CDPR I completed my PhD at the University of Calgary under [Robin Cockett](https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/) in category theory, where I was broadly interested in abstract ideas of differentiation. I split my attention between differentiable programming languages (what does it mean to differentiate a computer program) and Lie theory (what does it mean to differentiate a function that respects internal symmetries of spaces)
